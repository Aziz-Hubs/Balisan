## Strategic Shift: Desktop-First Premium

While the initial build focused on mobile-first responsiveness, these enhancement phases shift the priority to **visual excellence** and **workflow efficiency** on large screens.

### Design Principles for Desktop
1. **Utilize Space:** No more single-column content. Multi-column layouts allow for secondary contexts (filtering, related recipes, staff notes) to remain visible.
2. **Interactive Hover States:** Extensive use of hover-to-reveal, hover-to-zoom, and contextual popovers that are unique to mouse-based interactions.
3. **Immersive Motion:** Use of Framer Motion for scroll-linked animations and smooth transitions between large visual sections.
4. **Productivity Tools:** Keyboard shortcuts and bulk management tools designed for desktop power users (like corporate gifters).
